## Context

Welcome to the official web crawlers repository for [Burplist](https://burplist.me) built using [Scrapy](https://scrapy.org/).

Growing up in a frugal family, I would spend hours browsing online, looking for the best bang for my bucks. Needless to say, the process was super exhausting and slowly turns into frustration.

So then I thought, why not just create a search engine for craft beers?

## Requirements

-   [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
-   [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)
-   [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)
-   [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

## Development

Skip to the [Usage](#usage) `docker-compose` section if you only want to try it out locally.

### Installing dependencies

```sh
poetry install

# Optional: to install dependencies only
poetry install --no-root
```

### Updating dependencies

```sh
poetry update
```

### Setup pre-commit Hooks

[pre-commit hooks](https://pre-commit.com/index.html#installation) should already be installed after the installation step above.

Some example useful invocations:

-   `pre-commit install`: Default invocation. Installs the pre-commit script alongside any existing git hooks.
-   `pre-commit install --install-hooks --overwrite`: Idempotently replaces existing git hook scripts with pre-commit, and also installs hook environments.

### Database migration (optional)

This is not needed for fresh installation. You would only need this if you update any database models.

For database migration steps, please read [this](alembic/README.md).

### Setting up local database

Instructions to set up a database with Docker. Feel free to skip this step if you intend to use `docker-compose`.

However, if you intend to work on development work, setting this up would be worthwhile.

1. To spin up a `postgres` Docker container:

    ```sh
    docker run -d --name dpostgres -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD=trust postgres:latest
    ```

2. To start the PostgreSQL Docker container, simply use `docker start dpostgres`

3. To run `psql`, do `docker exec -it dpostgres psql -U postgres`

4. Create a database using `CREATE DATABASE burplist;`

## Usage

### List all available spiders

```sh
poetry run scrapy list
```

### Using `docker-compose`

This step builds and runs the Burplist `scrapy` application along with a `postgres` Docker container.

This is perfect for users who simply wants to try out the application locally.

```sh
# To build and start scraping with all available spiders
docker-compose up -d --build

# To run all available spiders after build
docker start burplist_scrapy
```

### Run single spider

```sh
# To run a single spider
poetry run scrapy crawl thirsty

# To run single spider with json output
poetry run scrapy crawl coldstorage -o coldstorage.json
```

### Run all spiders

```sh
poetry run scrapy list | xargs -n 1 poetry run scrapy crawl


```

### Run all spiders, in parallel

```sh
poetry shell
scrapy list | xargs -n 1 -P 0 scrapy crawl
```

### Run on Heroku (optional)

This project is deployed on Heroku. To run on Heroku, you'll need to install [the Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli).

```sh
heroku run scrapy list | xargs -n 1 heroku run scrapy crawl
```

---

## Proxy and Sentry (optional)

[ScraperAPI](https://www.scraperapi.com/?fp_ref=jerryng) is used as our proxy server provider.
[Sentry](https://sentry.io/) is used for error monitoring.

```sh
export SCRAPER_API_KEY="<YOUR_SCRAPER_API_KEY>"
export SENTRY_DSN="<YOUR_SENTRY_DSN>"
```
